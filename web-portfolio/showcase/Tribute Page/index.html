                <h2>Short Summary if his life</h2>
                <p>
                    Robin Williams was born in Chicago, Illinois on July 21, 1951. 
                    Even though he graduated highschool with the vote of
                    "Most Likely not to Succeed" and the "Funniest" by his class mates,
                    he went on to studying at Juilliard in 1973. He started off his career
                    doing stand-up comedy where he was seen by George Schlatter during an
                    act and debuted in his first TV show called Laugh-in. He married two
                    times before he married his last wife Susan Schneider in 2011. He had
                    three children, one with his first wife, and the other two with the 
                    second, one of which is named Zelda Rae Williams. On August 11, 2014,
                    Williams died in his home at 63.
